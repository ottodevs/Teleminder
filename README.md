Teleminder is a telegram bot to remind you to take your meds.

Once a day, it sends you a message remembering to take your med at one specific time.

    - If you take it, you will receive a random cat gif.

    - If you take it late, it will send you a sad cat.

    - If you don't take it, it will remind you again in half hour.
